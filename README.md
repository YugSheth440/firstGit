| Binary search | Linear Search |
| --- | --- |
| In linear search input data need not to be in sorted. | In binary search input data need to be in sorted order. |
| The time complexity of linear search **O(n)**. | The time complexity of binary search **O(log n)**. |

# Following used to write code
```
def dot_product(vector1, vector2):
    return sum(x * y for x, y in zip(vector1, vector2))

vector1 = [1, 2, 3]
vector2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = dot_product(vector1, vector2)
print("Dot product:", result)
```
# Dot product Mathematical expression
The following is inline mathematical expression : $$A.B=|A||B|cos\theta$$
